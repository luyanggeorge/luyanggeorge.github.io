# Jobs
# VP of Global Communications
- company: University of Leeds
  position: Marie Curie Research Fellow
  duration: November 2020 &mdash; November 2023
  summary: Funded by the EU Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, I have taken a three-year position as an Early-Stage Researcher to work on a Horizon 2020 European Industry Doctorate project entitled "Eagre/Aegir: high-seas wave-impact modelling" (project number: 859983). The Marie Curie Actions offer the opportunity to combine academic research with industrial experiences and support inter-discipline and international research. Within this framework, a collaboration between the University of Leeds, the UK and the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN), the Netherlands has been set up, where I spent the first 18 months at the former to develop the mathematical and computational model, and the second half at the latter to perform the verifications and validations of the model.
#           The target of the subproject I have undertaken, which is entitled “ExtremeWaves”, focuses on better modelling of nonlinear water waves. It is set in the context of maritime-engineering sector. Its overall goal is to develop mathematical models, and accordingly, deliver computational modelling tools for simulating three-dimensional water waves as well as wave interactions commonly seen in this field. The goal has been achieved by using "Firedrake", a general finite-element simulation environment, where advanced numerical analysis and efficient implementation and validation have been performed.

# Director of Digital Stratgy
- company: Maritime Research Institute Netherlands (MARIN)
  position: Visiting Researcher
  duration:  June 2022 &mdash; October 2023
  summary: As part of the three-year Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) Innovative Training Networks project that I have been participating in, entitled "Eagre/Aegir: high-seas wave-impact modelling", I have undertaken a secondment at the Maritime Research Institue Netherlands (MARIN), the Netherlands after 18 months of study and research at the University of Leeds, the UK. I worked as a Visiting Researcher to continue my research on mathematical and computational modelling of nonlinear water waves, which was expected to be empowered by the experiments conducted at the wave basin facilities here at MARIN.
